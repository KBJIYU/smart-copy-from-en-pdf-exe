“The teacher told a joke in class. He asked, ‘can anyone here prove that the Earth is round?’ When nobody could answer 
his question, a boy raised his hand and 
directed the question back at
 the teacher, who then said, ‘I can’t. I never said it was.’ We all laughed,” my friend told me.
"That's funny," I replied, "Goodbye!" My friend stood in front of me alone, like a sad man.
