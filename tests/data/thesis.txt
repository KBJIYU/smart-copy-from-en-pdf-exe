Now let’s come back again to diversification. In order to understand how to diversify a
portfolio we should understand the risk. According to Ibbotson et al. [11] risk has two
components, systematic and unsystematic. Where market forces affect all assets
simultaneously in some systematic manner it generates Systematic risk or what so called,
undiversifiable risk. Examples are Bull markets, Bear markets, wars, changes in the level of
inflation. The other component of risk is unsystematic one, or so called diversifiable risk.
These are idiosyncratic events that are statistically independent from the more widespread
forces that generate undiversifiable risk. The examples of a diversifiable risk are Acts of God
(Hurricane or flood), inventions, management errors, lawsuits and good or bad news affecting
one firm.
As defined above, Total risk of a portfolio is the result of summation of systematic and
unsystematic risks. On average, the total risk of a diversified portfolio tends to diminish as
more randomly selected common stocks are added to the portfolio. But, when more than
about three dozen random stocks are combined, it is impossible to reduce a randomly selected
portfolio’s risk below the level of undiversifiable risk that exists in the market. Figure 4
shows the graphical interpretation of this. The straight line separates the systematic risk from
unsystematic one, the systematic or undiversifiable risk lies under the straight line.
